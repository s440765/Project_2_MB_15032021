This code is using the Brest Cancer Data set form the mlbench library

6 models are used for classification of "Class" for tumors to be Benign or Malignant 
-Support Vector Machines
-Naive Bayes
-Neural Net Work
-Decisions Trees
-Random Forests
-Regularised Discriminat Analysis

At the end and Ensemble was built to take all results from all the models and take the majority vote for classification.
